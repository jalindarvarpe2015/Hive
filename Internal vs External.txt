#Introduction to Hive Internal and External tables
 

Fundamentally, Hive knows two different types of tables: Internal table and the External table. 
The Internal table is also known as the managed table.

We can identify the internal or External tables using the DESCRIBE FORMATTED table_name statement in the Hive, which will display either MANAGED_TABLE or EXTERNAL_TABLE depending on the table type.



1. Hive Internal Table
Hive owns the data for the internal tables.

It is the default table in Hive. When the user creates a table in Hive without specifying it as external, then by default, an internal table gets created in a specific location in HDFS.

By default, an internal table will be created in a folder path similar to /user/hive/warehouse directory of HDFS. We can override the default location by the location property during table creation.

If we drop the managed table or partition, the table data and the metadata associated with that table will be deleted from the HDFS.



2. Hive External Table
Hive does not manage the data of the External table.

We create an external table for external use as when we want to use the data outside the Hive.

External tables are stored outside the warehouse directory. They can access data stored in sources such as remote HDFS locations or Azure Storage Volumes.

Whenever we drop the external table, then only the metadata associated with the table will get deleted, the table data remains untouched by Hive.

We can create the external table by specifying the EXTERNAL keyword in the Hive create table statement.
