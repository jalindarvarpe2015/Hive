Partitioning in Hive

1.Static Partitioning (Manual Partitioning) : - In static Partitioning, you will specify the partition column while loading the data.

2.Dynamic Partitioning : - In dynamic partitioning , you will push the data into hive and then hive decides which value should go into which partition.

To enable dynamic partitioning, you have to set 
 set hive.exec.dynamic.partition=true;
